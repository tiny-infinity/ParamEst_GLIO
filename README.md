Code for my assignment for the course Parameter Estimation and Inverse Theory, offered at IISER Pune.

We were asked to pick an inverse problem of our liking and well, solve it. I have chosen to work on estimating parameters that describe the growth and proliferation of glioblastomas, which are a kind of brain tumour, using MRI data. 

The work is mainly based on [this](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6420/ab649c) paper by Subramaniam et al. Here, the authors have worked on 3D images. I, however, do not have the resources to do that (i.e a cluster computer) and therefore have resorted to two-dimensional version of the same problem, which can somewhat be seen as analysing slices/layers of the 3D images.

Everything is implemented on Python.
